# Enhanced Production Logging Guide

## Overview

I've enhanced the signup completion API (`/api/signup/complete`) with comprehensive logging to help debug production issues. Each request now gets a unique ID and detailed step-by-step logging.

## What's New

### Request Tracking
- **Request ID**: Each request gets a unique 7-character ID (e.g., `[a2b3c4d]`)
- **Timing**: Tracks total processing time for performance monitoring
- **Environment Check**: Validates Supabase configuration at request start

### Enhanced Error Codes
All errors now include:
- `errorCode`: Specific error identifier for categorization
- `requestId`: Unique request identifier for log correlation
- `processingTime`: How long the request took before failing

### Error Code Reference

| Error Code | Description | Common Causes |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `INVALID_JSON` | Request body is not valid JSON | Malformed request data |
| `MISSING_FIELDS` | Required fields are missing | Frontend validation bypassed |
| `INVALID_PASSWORD` | Password doesn't meet requirements | Password validation rules |
| `PASSWORD_TOO_SHORT` | Fallback validation failed | Password < 8 characters |
| `RESERVED_SLUG` | Attempted to use reserved URL | System slug collision |
| `INVALID_TOKEN` | Invitation token not found | Expired/invalid invitation |
| `INVITATION_ALREADY_USED` | Token already consumed | Duplicate signup attempt |
| `INVITATION_EXPIRED` | Token past expiration | Time-based validation |
| `EMAIL_MISMATCH` | Email doesn't match invitation | User error |
| `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Account exists for email | Duplicate account |
| `SUPABASE_USER_CREATION_FAILED` | Supabase auth creation failed | **Most likely production issue** |
| `LOCAL_USER_CREATION_FAILED` | Database user record failed | Database connectivity |
| `PORTFOLIO_CREATION_FAILED` | Portfolio creation failed | Database constraints |
| `SIGNUP_COMPLETION_FAILED` | Unexpected error | Catch-all for unknown issues |

## Key Logging Sections

### 1. Request Analysis
```
🔧 [a2b3c4d] Signup completion request received at 2025-09-02T...
🔧 [a2b3c4d] Environment check: {hasSupabaseUrl: true, hasSupabaseServiceKey: true, ...}
📋 [a2b3c4d] Request data structure: {hasToken: true, tokenLength: 32, email: "user@example.com", ...}
```

### 2. Password Validation
```
🔐 [a2b3c4d] Validating password (length: 12)
✅ [a2b3c4d] Password validation passed
```

### 3. Supabase User Creation (Critical Section)
```
👤 [a2b3c4d] Creating Supabase user...
👤 [a2b3c4d] User creation payload: {email: "user@example.com", hasPassword: true, passwordLength: 12, ...}
✅ [a2b3c4d] Supabase user created: {userId: "uuid-here", email: "user@example.com", ...}
```

### 4. Success Response
```
🎉 [a2b3c4d] Signup completed successfully in 1250ms!
```

## Production Debugging

When a user reports "Failed to complete signup":

1. **Find the logs** using the timestamp of their attempt
2. **Look for the request ID** in the initial log line
3. **Follow the emoji trail** to see exactly where it failed:
   - 🔧 = Request received
   - 📋 = Request parsing
   - 🔐 = Password validation
   - 🎫 = Invitation validation
   - 👤 = Supabase user creation ⚠️ **Most common failure point**
   - 🏠 = Local user creation
   - 🎨 = Portfolio creation
   - 📁 = Gallery creation
   - ✅ = Invitation marking
   - 🎉 = Success

4. **Check error details** - each error includes specific information about what went wrong

## Most Likely Issues

Based on the error pattern "Failed to complete signup", the most likely culprits are:

1. **Supabase Authentication Issues** (`SUPABASE_USER_CREATION_FAILED`)
   - Environment variables missing/incorrect in production
   - Supabase service role key permissions
   - Password policy conflicts

2. **Database Connection Issues** (`LOCAL_USER_CREATION_FAILED`, `PORTFOLIO_CREATION_FAILED`)
   - Database connectivity
   - Schema migration issues
   - Constraint violations

3. **Environment Configuration** 
   - Missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - Production vs development environment differences

## Next Steps

1. Deploy this enhanced version to production
2. Test with a fresh invitation
3. Monitor logs with the new request ID system
4. Look for the specific error code to identify the exact failure point

The logs will now show exactly where the signup process fails, making it much easier to identify and fix production issues.
