# Email Setup Guide

## Overview

Your application now has full email functionality integrated using [Resend](https://resend.com), a modern email service built for developers. All invitation emails will be sent automatically when you invite artists or users.

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### 1. Create a Resend Account
- Go to [resend.com](https://resend.com)
- Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free tier)
- Verify your email address

### 2. Get Your API Key
- Navigate to [API Keys](https://resend.com/api-keys) in your Resend dashboard
- Click "Create API Key" 
- Name it something like "Gorsite Production" or "Art Gallery"
- Copy the API key (starts with `re_`)

### 3. Add to Environment Variables
Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

### 4. Set Up Your Domain (Optional but Recommended)
For production, you should send emails from your own domain:

1. Go to [Domains](https://resend.com/domains) in Resend
2. Add your domain (e.g., `artpop.vercel.app`)
3. Add the DNS records to your domain provider
4. Update the `from` field in `/src/lib/email.ts` to use your domain
